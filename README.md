1. No idea how to do step 3. when I was suppose to make a customized effect, since I have zero knowledge on how and where to incorporate the code into mine since I have no idea what to do with it. Tried asking for help however, no mentor responded except one and he help me with a few issues. 
2. Where to get the custom images for the tabs for "Now Playing" and "Top Rated".
